# Greenhouse Manager

## Description

The main premise of **Greenhouse Manager** is to buy and care for plants and sell them to make a profit. To win the 
game the user must use revenue from plant sales to pay off their business loan debt. Once the debt is paid, *the user 
wins the game*. The audience for this game is anyone interested in simulation games or plants. I chose this project because in 
my many personal projects I have never developed a game before and would like to challenge myself by trying to develop 
something new for myself. I specifically chose simulating plant care because I enjoy the agriculture feature in main 
stream games like Minecraft and Animal Crossing.

### Phase 3 (To be Implemented)
1. As a user, I want the plant to be removed from the greenhouse if hydration reaches zero
2. As a user, I want the option to buy a cactus.
> The cactus plant grows slowly and requires less frequent watering. 
The cactus can be sold for a profit when it reaches a mature age, otherwise it is sold for a loss.
3. As a user, I want to be able to plant a flower
> The flower plant grows faster compared to the cactus but requires more frequent watering.
The flower can be sold for a profit when it reaches a mature age. otherwise it is sold for a loss.
When the flower is ready to be sold it blooms to a random color, that can influence the sale price.
The more rare the color it blooms to, the higher the sale price of the flower.
