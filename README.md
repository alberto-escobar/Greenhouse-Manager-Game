# Greenhouse Manager

## Description

The main premise of **Greenhouse Manager** is to buy and care for plants and sell them to make a profit. To win the 
game the user must use revenue from plant sales to pay off their business loan debt. Once the debt is paid, *the user 
wins the game*. The audience for this game is anyone interested in simulation games or plants. I chose this project because in 
my many personal projects I have never developed a game before and would like to challenge myself by trying to develop 
something new for myself. I specifically chose simulating plant care because I enjoy the agriculture feature in main 
stream games like Minecraft and Animal Crossing.
